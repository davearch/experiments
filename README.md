Experiments
===========

My solutions to the mega project ideas list (http://www.dreamincode.net/forums/topic/78802-martyr2s-mega-project-ideas-list/).

Also just random and small applications.

I will try to implement a variety of languages (java, python, lisp, C, etc.)

I also have a directory of project Euler, which I plan on finishing before the end of the year.
