WebScrap - Download images

This module crawls the treeflow.info website, finds the images on the relevant
pages, downloads said images, and finally compresses them into a convenient
.tar file.

webScrap emerged out of necessity from a problem at work, but I decided to
continue polishing the script out of a desire to learn the python language as
well as its module system.
